  A genetic matching algorithm is extended to take into account primitive arcs in a pattern recognition process. Usually approaches based on segments are sensitive to over segmentation effects. Handling with more accurate description allows to improve the recognition by limiting the number of vertices to be matched and so to decrease processing time. Experimental studies using real data attest the robustness of the proposed method.
